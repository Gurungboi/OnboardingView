# OnboardingView


The onboarding screen in this Swift-based app uses a TabView component to enable users to navigate by either swiping left or right or clicking buttons. In order to ensure code quality and follow clean code architecture principles, a separate module has been created for SwiftLint. SwiftLint is a widely-used open-source tool that analyzes code for potential issues, including style violations, and provides suggestions to help maintain a consistent codebase. By using a separate module for SwiftLint, the codebase is easier to manage and maintain, leading to improved overall code quality, scalability, and adaptability to future changes and updates.


## Swift Package Manager (SPM)
- Swift Lint

### How to use Swift Lint?

- Open the command line interface (CLI) on your computer.
- Navigate to the directory where your Swift project is located. You can do this by using the cd command followed by the directory path. For example, if your project is located in the Documents folder, you can enter cd ~/Documents/MyProject and press Enter.
- Once you're in the project directory, enter the swiftlint --fix command and press Enter.
- SwiftLint will analyze your code and suggest any fixes to the violations it finds based on the rules defined in your SwiftLint configuration file.
- If any fixes are applied, SwiftLint will update your code with the suggested changes.
- Review the suggested changes to ensure that they are appropriate for your project.

### Note that before using **`swiftlint --fix`**, you need to have SwiftLint installed on your computer. You can install SwiftLint using a package manager like Homebrew or Mint, or by downloading the SwiftLint binary from the SwiftLint GitHub repository.
